## 2. _due 10/25_ Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)
We will implement sorting algorithms(Quicksort and Merge sort) and measure their performance on MPI and OpenMP.
For example:
- Quicksort (OpenMP)
- Quicksort (MPI)
- Merge sort (OpenMP)
- Merge sort (MPI)
